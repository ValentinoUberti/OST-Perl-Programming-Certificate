2. Opening Filehandles

Objective

The file /software/Perl2/songz.txt contains the following text, which is equivalent to all the information you had in the previous lesson's project, in the format artist, title, album, length, genre, separated by colons:

	George_Harrison:My_Sweet_Lord:All Things Must Pass:4.65:Folk rock
	Manfred_Mann:Blinded_by_the_Light:The Roaring Silence:7.12:Progressive rock
	Manfred_Mann:Do_Wah_Diddy:None:2.37:Pop rock
	Manfred_Mann:The_Mighty_Quinn:Mighty Garvey!:2.85:Rock
	The_Hollies:Bus_Stop:The Graham Gouldman Thing:2.9:Rock
	The_Hollies:Carrie_Ann:None:2.92:Rock 

Write a program named songz.pl that reads the file (passed as a command line argument) and uses it to create the same files (including the same content) that you were given in the previous lesson. The files should be located in your perl2 directory.

Hand in songz.pl when you are done.
