14. Directory Reading Functions

Objective

You're going to create and destroy a lot of files, so make a special lesson14_project folder under your homework folder for this exercise.

	cold:~$ mkdir lesson14_project
	cold:~$ cd lesson14_project

Write a program in your /lesson14_project folder named alpha_bits.pl to:

 - create the 676 files named "aa", "ab", ..."ba", "bb", ... through "zz" (hint: perldoc perlop; read more fully about the range operator) each containing contents equal to their uppercased name.
 - print the contents of each of the files that has a letter q in their name (figure out what those files are as though you did not know you had just written them).
 - delete those files and count and print the number of files left that have two letters in their name (see perldoc -f unlink).

To run the program, type:

	cold1:~/$ cd homeworkfolder/lesson14_project
	cold1:~/$ homeworkfolder/lesson14_project$ ./alpha_bits.pl

Finally, write a one-liner to change the contents of every remaining file to reverse the letters contained within them (you can assume there are only two characters in each file).

You can submit the one-liner when you're done by putting it in a file named reverso.sh:

#!/bin/sh
perl -one-liner code goes here
Submit alpha_bits.pl and reverso.sh.
