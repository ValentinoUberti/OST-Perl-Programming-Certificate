13. For Loops and More Miscellaneous Topics

Objective

Copy this modified form of progress.pl and save it in your homework folder as progress2.pl:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

$| = 1;
for ( 1 .. 100 )
{
 long_operation( $_ );
 # Spin here
}
sub long_operation
{
 my $arg = shift;
 print "Processing element $arg\n" unless $arg % 15;
 sleep 1;
}

Replace the comment # Spin here with a call to a subroutine you write that takes the value of $_ from the for loop and then displays a "spinning" character made by switching between the characters '-', '\', '|', '/' on each call.
