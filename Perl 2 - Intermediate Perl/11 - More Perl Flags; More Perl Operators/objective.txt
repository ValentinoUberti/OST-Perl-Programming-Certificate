11. More Perl Flags; More Perl Operators

Objective

Run the program netstat on the terminal and observe the output. Write a one-liner to print out just the remote host (the non-whitespace characters preceding the last colon on the line) on lines 3 through 12, provided the line contains a colon. Feed the input using a pipe; that is, netstat | perl ....

Create a text file named stats.sh like this, including your one-liner:

#!/bin/sh
netstat | perl -one-liner code goes here

(You can run this file from the shell to test it.)

Submit stats.sh when you finish.
