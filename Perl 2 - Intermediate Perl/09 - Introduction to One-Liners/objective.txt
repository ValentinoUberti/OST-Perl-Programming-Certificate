9. Introduction to One-Liners

Objective

There is a file on your student machine (and all Unix/Linux machines) named /etc/passwd that contains information about the users of the machine. It consists of one line per user, with fields separated by colons:

 -  User name
 -  Unused ('x')
 -  User ID
 -  Group ID
 -  Full name
 -  Home directory
 -  Login shell

One line from this file will look like:

	username:x:userid:groupid:fullname:homedir:shell

Create a one-liner to count and print the number of each shell occurring in that file, sorted in descending order by count.

When you are satisfied with your one-liner, create a text file named shells.sh like this, including your one-liner as shown:

	#!/bin/sh
	perl -one-liner code goes here

You can run this file from the shell to test it.

We'll ask for one-liners in this form for other projects. This enables the instructor to test your solution without needing to copy and paste it.

The result from the one-liner should look something like this:

	/usr/bin/false: 48
	/var/empty/usr/bin/false: 2
	/bin/sh: 1
	/usr/sbin/uucico: 1
