4. Regular Expressions

Objective

Make a copy of reg_grep.pl named reg_grep2.pl and modify it to take two options, just like the Unix grep program:

    -v negates the match; print only lines that do not match the regex.
    -i makes it case-insensitive; match regardless of case.

Either or both options can be present or not, in any order, but if present, must occur before the rest of the arguments. For example: ./reg_grep2.pl -v perl ./*.pl or ./reg_grep2.pl -i -v Test ./*.test.
