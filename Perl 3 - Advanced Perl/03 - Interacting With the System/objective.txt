3. Interacting with the System

Objective

Run the command netstat -an at the command line and observe the output. Create a program in your /p3homework folder named port_report.pl that reads the output of netstat -an from a piped open and prints a list of unique port numbers that this machine is listening on.

If you're not familiar with netstat, the port number you're looking for is the number that occurs between a colon and white space on a line containing the word LISTEN.

When you are done, hand in your perl script.
