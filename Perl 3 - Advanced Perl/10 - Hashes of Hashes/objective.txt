10. Hashes of Hashes

Objective

Copy the last version of state.pl into your /p3homework folder and modify it as follows:

It takes a mandatory argument, the name of the file containing the data.
A provided data file, /software/Perl3/state_no_header.data, does not contain the header line.
A separate provided data file, /software/Perl3/state_header.key, contains the header information, only the names are one per line instead of being on a single line separated by pipe symbols.
There is a second mandatory argument, the abbreviation of a state. The program should output all the information it knows about that one state, without hard-coding the names of any of the attributes.
There is a third argument that is optional, the name of an attribute. If present, the program will print only the value of that attribute for the specified state abbreviation.
The program should die with a usage message if insufficient arguments are provided. It should die with an informative error if the key file is not found or the abbreviation is not found.
