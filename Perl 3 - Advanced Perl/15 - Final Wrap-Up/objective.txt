15. Final Wrap-Up

Objective

Start with the adventure game dispatch.pl from Lesson 12 (either the class version or your working extension in the homework). Make a copy in your /p3homework folder named dispatch2.pl and modify the copy to remove the static initializations of the hashes %inventory, %room_contents, and %location, and add another hash, %exit. Populate all of these hashes instead from the data file dungeon, which is in the /software/Perl3 folder. The structure of %exit will be equivalent to, for example:
Hash structure

%exit = ( attic => { down => 'house', east => 'mine' } )

Implement the additional command go, which takes one argument, and moves you in the direction indicated, provided it is a valid exit from your current location. Add a listing of available exits to the look command. Here is a sample dialog that should be possible with your program:
