12. References to Subroutines

Objective

Copy the game dispatch.pl from the lesson into your /p3homework folder. Notice that the names of the subroutines are only ever used once, in the definition of the dispatch table. Now you want the word "slay" to be synonymous with "kill," so the subroutine that gets executed should do exactly the same, except that instead of printing "kill," it should print "slay." Your goal is to do this without copying the kill subroutine, but instead, create a closure over the particular verb. This is a sample dialog that should result:

Expected Output:

cold:~/p3homework$ ./dispatch.pl
Command: take sword
 Taken
Command: kill troll 
 Kill who with what?
Command: kill troll with sword
 Killed!
Command: quit
cold:~/p3homework$ ./dispatch.pl
Command: take sword
 Taken
Command: slay frog with sword  
 No frog to slay
Command: slay troll with sword
 Slayed!
Command: quit

It might help to know that in a double-quoted string, if you want to print a variable followed by letters that would be interpreted as part of the variable name, you can do it with braces: "${verb}ed!" Also, that the escape sequence \u in a double-quoted string uppercases the next letter: "\u$verb..."
