1. Prerequisites, Review, and Slices

Objective

Write a one-liner that is the equivalent of the Unix factor program: it should print out all the prime factors of its input. A prime factor is an integer greater than one that is not divisible by any numbers other than itself.

Create a text file named factor.sh in your /p3homework folder like this, including your one-liner:

#!/bin/sh

perl
 -one-liner code goes here
(You can run this file from the shell to test it.)

Here are some examples of the results your one-liner should produce:

cold:~$ perl -le '...' 7
7
cold:~$ perl -le '...' 12
2

3
cold:~$ perl -le '...' 69

cold:~$ perl -le '...' 5544
