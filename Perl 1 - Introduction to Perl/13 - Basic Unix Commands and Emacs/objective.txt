13 Basic Unix Commands and Emacs

Objective

Create a new folder at the command line named MyFiles. Create a file in this folder using the emacs editor named myfile.txt. It doesn't matter what the file contains, as long as you use emacs to create it.

When you finish, hand in only the myfile.txt file, not the MyFiles folder.
