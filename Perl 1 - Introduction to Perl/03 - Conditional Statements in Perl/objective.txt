3. Conditional Statements in Perl

Objective

Create a new script named evaluate.pl with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $principal = 100000;
my $interest_rate = 7; # %
my $term = 20; # Years
my $total_paid = $principal * (1 + $interest_rate/100) ** $term;
print "Value of principal + interest after ", $term, " years = ", $total_paid, "\n";

Modify this program for printing loan payments as follows:

 - Declare a variable $cash and initialize it to some number.
 - Instead of printing out the total loan payment, test the value of $cash against the value of $total_paid to see whether there is enough cash to pay off the loan:
 - If $cash is more than 10% larger than the value of $total_paid, print "Approved."
 - If $cash is between 0% and 10% larger than $total_paid, print "Marginal."
 - If $cash is less than $total_paid, print "Unacceptable."

When you finish, hand in your program.
