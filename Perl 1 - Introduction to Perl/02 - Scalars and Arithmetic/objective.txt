2. Scalars and Arithmetic

Objective

For this project, you will calculate the total payment on a loan of $100,000 for 20 years at 7%.
Create a new perl script named interest.pl with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
    
my $principal = 100000;
my $interest_rate = 7; # %
my $term = 20; # Years
# XXX
print "Value of principal + interest after ", $term, " years = ", $total_paid, "\n";

Your job is to replace the comment marked XXX with a statement that will cause the rest of the program to print the right answer.

The formula for interest—the one we want you to use, anyway—is: C = P * (1 + R/100) ** T, where:

C = total cost of loan (principal + interest)
P = principal
R = interest rate in percent
T = term in years

When you are finished, hand in interest.pl.
