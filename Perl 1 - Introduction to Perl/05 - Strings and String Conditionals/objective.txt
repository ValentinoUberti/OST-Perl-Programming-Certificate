5. Strings and String Conditionals

Objective

The x operator is used to produce multiple copies of a string: the expression "Oh" x 3 evaluates to "OhOhOh".

You'll need to use the x operator for this project. You can read more about it by running perldoc perlop or visit the perldoc site, "Multiplicative Operators."

Create a new file named name_printer.pl with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $boss_first_name = "Penelope";
my $boss_last_name = "Creighton-Ward";
my $butler_first_name = "Aloysius";
my $butler_last_name = "Parker";

my $field_width = 15;

print '|', ' 'x$field_width, '|', ' 'x$field_width, "|\n"; 

Change this program so it will print out a line containing the boss's first and last names in the first field and the butler's first and last names in the second field.
If a full name does not fit in a field, print out the first name only and then print the last name on the next line.
The names should be left-justified in the fields.

The output with the above settings should look like:

|                          |                        | 
|Penelope            |Aloysius Parker| 
|Creighton-Ward |                        | 

Try it with some of your own names.

This program will be quite a bit longer than the ones you have written so far, probably about 50 lines.
