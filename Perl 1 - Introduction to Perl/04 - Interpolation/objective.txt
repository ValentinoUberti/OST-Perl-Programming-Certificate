4. Interpolation

Objective

Create a new file named apples.pl with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
my $apples = 0;
my $got = 'apples';
# xxx
print yyy

Leave the # xxx comment in for now. Replace yyy with a double-quoted string that will cause the program to output

	I have 0 apples

Now change the 0 to a 1 in the initialization of $apples and rerun your program. See how it emits the grammatically incorrect:

	I have 1 apples

Now insert an if clause in place of the # xxx comment that will cause the program to print out:

	I have 1 apple

Write that if clause so that when you change the 1 in the initialization back to a 0, without making any other changes to the code, the program now prints out the correct:

	I have 0 apples

This should also be true for any number besides 1.

When you finish, hand in apples.pl.
