7. Arrays and Array Functions

Objective

Create sanitizer.pl with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $name = "Charles Francis Xavier";
$name = "Hiram K. Hackenbacker";
$name = "James Moriarty";
$name = "Samuel Finley Breese Morse";

Next, add code after each assignment to $name that will print out the name in a "sanitized" form of "First M. Last"; that is, first name, space, middle initial, period, space, last name.

If there is no middle name, print the letter X with no period following it. If there are multiple middle names, use the initial of the first one.

Keep in mind that a general method for processing a name is required. In other words, the same method should work for all the $name assignments.

When you finish, hand in your program.
