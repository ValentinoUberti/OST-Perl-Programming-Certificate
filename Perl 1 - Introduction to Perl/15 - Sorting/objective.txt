15. Sorting

Objective

Copy store_report.pl to a new file named store_report_sorted.pl.

Modify store_report_sorted.pl so that instead of the sales numbers being internal to the program, they are supplied on the command line.

When you finish with this, both of these commands should produce the same output:

	./store_report.pl
	./store_report_sorted.pl "White Peaches" 12 "Rainier Cherries" 20 Durien -1 "Spartan Apples" 24

The output should look like this:

	*** Sold 20 of Rainier Cherries, which were not in inventory
	 1.45 120 California Avocados
	 1.50 400 Cherry Tomatoes
	10.50 11 Durien
	 0.40 1476 Spartan Apples
	 0.95 288 White Peaches

Modify store_report_sorted.pl to print a message if if a sale would decrease inventory levels below zero.

Hand in store_report_sorted.pl when you finish.
