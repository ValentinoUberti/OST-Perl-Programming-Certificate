3.  Working with Objects

Objective

Copy BankAccount.pm and usebank.pl from your /perl4 folder to your /perl4homework/Project03 folder. In the /perl4homework/Project03 folder, modify usebank.pl as follows:

CODE TO EDIT:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use BankAccount;

my $personal_account = BankAccount->new( owner => 'me',
 balance => 1000,
 overdraft_limit => 500 );
$personal_account->credit( 300 );
$personal_account->debit( 100 );
my $slush_fund = BankAccount->new( owner => 'you',
 balance => 10000 );
$slush_fund->transfer( 5000, $personal_account );
print "New balance on my account = \$", $personal_account->balance, "\n";
print $personal_account->statement;
print $slush_fund->statement;

Now, modify BankAccount.pm (in /perl4homework/Project03) to provide the statement routine such that running usebank.pl will generate this output:

Expected Output:

cold:~/perl4homework/Project03$ ./usebank.pl
New balance on my account = $6200
29-Mar-2011 credit 300
29-Mar-2011 debit -100
29-Mar-2011 Transfer from 10002 5000
29-Mar-2011 Transfer to 10001 -5000

There are tabs between the fields there. You can use strftime in the POSIX module to print the date. When you finish, hand in your modified BankAccount.pm and usebank.pl.
