Objective

Copy all of the banking application files to your /perl4homework/Project15 folder:

	atm_choose.cgi
	atm_choose.tmpl
	atm_select.cgi
	atm_select.tmpl
	atm_timed.cgi
	atm_timed.tmpl
	Bank.pm
	MyTemplate.pm

and move the code between the sleep and the exit calls from atm_timed.cgi to a method add_transaction in Bank::Account such that the code in atm_timed.cgi can be replaced with the following and still work:

Code Fragment
 sleep $to_sleep;
 my ($account) = Bank::Account->search( account_number => $account_number );
 $account->add_transaction( $type, $amount );
 exit;
Next, insert code in the add_transaction method that will email you if the balance on an account drops below zero. You can hard-code your email address in.

When you finish, hand in all eight files from your Project15 folder.
