8. Database Programming in Perl

Objective

Copy bank_mysql_statement.pl and MySQL_Common.pm from the /perl4 folder to /perl4homework/Project08 and modify bank_mysql_statement.pl so that it prints out the statement just for the account number that is entered on the command line:

Expected Dialogue:

cold:~/perl4homework/Project08$ ./bank_mysql_statement.pl
Password: 
Usage: ./project.pl account_number
cold:~/perl4homework/Project08$ ./bank_mysql_statement.pl 12345
No such account number
cold:~/perl4homework/Project08$ ./bank_mysql_statement.pl 10001
Password: 
Account #: 10001
Owner(s): Peter Scott, Grace Scott
Date Type Amount Balance
2011-04-25 12:12:44 debit 200 4800
 
Hint: You can reuse the existing query on the accounts table; just add a WHERE clause on the account_number and pass in the number via a placeholder.

When you finish, hand in bank_mysql_statement.pl and MySQL_Common.pm.
