4. Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Inside-Out Objects

Objective

Copy the latest version of BankAccount.pm from your /perl4 folder to your /perl4homework/Project04 folder. Then, create the following version of SavingsAccount.pm in your perl4homework/Project04 folder:

package SavingsAccount;
use strict;
use warnings;

my $Interest_Rate = 0.015;
use BankAccount;

BEGIN{ our @ISA = qw(BankAccount) }

sub add_interest
{
 my $self = shift;
 my $pct = $Interest_Rate * 100;
 $self->transact( "Interest at $pct%", $self->balance * $Interest_Rate );
}

1;

Change it to provide a class method, set_interest_rate, that allows the caller to set the interest rate. Test it with this version of usebank.pl:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use SavingsAccount;

my $piggybank = SavingsAccount->new( balance => 5000 );
SavingsAccount->set_interest_rate( 0.02 );
$piggybank->add_interest;
print $piggybank->balance, "\n";

The output should be:

Expected Output:

cold:~/perl4homework/Project04$ ./usebank.pl
5100

When you finish, hand in your modified SavingsAccount.pm, along with usebank.pl and BankAccount.pm.
