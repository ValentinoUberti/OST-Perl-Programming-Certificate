1. Introduction: Packages

Objective

Create a /perl4homework folder for your homework projects, and create a /Project01 subfolder in it for this project. Copy the partial program below into the CodeRunner editor, save it in /perl4homework/Project01 as package_homework.pl, and do what the comments say:

CODE TO COPY
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

{
 our @array = qw(Max Headroom);
}

sub first
{
 print "I am in first()\n";
}

package old;

{
 package new;

 our $scalar = "Fred";
}

sub second
{
 print "I am in second()\n";
}

# Replace the following comments with one or more statements that perform what each comment says.
# The requirement here is to demonstrate that you can use multiple
# ways of accessing the package variables and subroutines wherever they exist.
# Do not alter any code above this line.

# Print @array by using 'package' and 'our'
# Print @array by using an explicit package in the variable
# Call first() by using 'package'
# Call first() by using an explicit package in its name
# Print $scalar by using 'package' and 'our'
# Print $scalar by using an explicit package in the variable
# Call second() by using 'package'
# Call second() by using an explicit package in its name


When you finish, hand in package_homework.pl.
