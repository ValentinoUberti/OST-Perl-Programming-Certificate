10. Web Programming, on Web Clients

Objective

You are going to scrape part of the O'Reilly School of Technology site, but so that we didn't break this lesson by changing the site, we have created a static mirror of the necessary parts of the site. You can explore this site in your browser. The URL to start from is http://perl4.oreillyschool.com/ost-mirror/. Using WWW::Mechanize, follow the link labelled 'Contact', then fill in just your name on the form on the next page (this is the first visible field), and submit the form.

If you have done this correctly, the resulting page will contain an answer to the riddle: "Why is a camel like a lemon?" The answer will be between the tags <B>...</B> and there will be no other angle brackets on the page. Have your script print out the answer to the riddle.

Create a program in your /perl4homework/Project10 folder named scraper.pl to answer the riddle.

When you finish, hand in your scraper.pl program.
