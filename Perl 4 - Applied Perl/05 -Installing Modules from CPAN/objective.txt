5. Installing Modules from CPAN

Objective

Install the module DBI into ~/mylib. Hand in the list of commands you used to do this and the output of this command:

perl ... -MDBI -le 'print $DBI::VERSION'
Replace ... with the correct options to make the command work and include the complete command with your submission.

Find where the total number of tests run is reported and turn in that number also.

Create a /Project05 folder in your /perl4homework folder. Use the Unix/Linux script command (http://www.computerhope.com/unix/uscript.htm) to record your output in a text file, dbiresults.txt, in the project folder, and hand that file in.
